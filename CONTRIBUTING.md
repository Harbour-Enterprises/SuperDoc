- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Provide a detailed description of the proposed feature
- Explain why this feature would be useful
- Include mockups or examples if applicable

### Documentation Improvements

Documentation is crucial for our project. You can help by:

- Fixing typos and grammar
- Adding code examples
- Improving explanations
- Adding new sections
- Translating documentation

### Code Contributions

#### Types of Contributions

1. **Bug fixes**: Resolve existing issues
2. **Features**: Implement new functionality
3. **Performance improvements**: Optimize existing code
4. **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
5. **Framework integrations**: Create examples for different frameworks
6. **Documentation**: Improve SuperDoc documentation

## Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harbour-Enterprises/SuperDoc.git
   cd SuperDoc
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Development Environment**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Branch Naming**:

   - `feature/description` for new features
   - `fix/description` for bug fixes
   - `docs/description` for documentation changes
   - `perf/description` for performance improvements

2. **Commit Messages**:

   Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

   ```
   feat: add real-time cursor sharing

   - Implement cursor position tracking
   - Add websocket connection for updates
   - Include user identification

   Closes #123
   ```

3. **Automated Checks**:

   When you open a PR, the following checks run automatically:

   - Commit message validation
   - Code formatting (Prettier)
   - Linting (ESLint)
   - Unit tests
   - Visual regression tests (if UI changes)
   - E2E tests (for PRs to main)

4. **Before Submitting**:

   - Update documentation if needed
   - Add or update tests
   - Run the test suite locally
   - Ensure all CI checks pass

5. **Pull Request Description**:
   - Describe the changes
   - Link to related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - List any breaking changes
   - Mention dependencies added/removed

## Release Process

SuperDoc uses a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with semantic-release. **No manual version bumps are needed.**

### How It Works

#### Branch Strategy

- **`main` branch** ‚Üí Pre-release versions (`@next` tag on npm)
- **`stable` branch** ‚Üí Stable versions (`@latest` tag on npm)
- **`X.x` branches** ‚Üí Maintenance versions (`@X.x` tags on npm)

#### Version Control Through Commits

Your commit messages automatically determine version changes:

| Commit Type                                       | Version Bump      | Example                               | Result        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `fix:`                                            | Patch (0.0.X)     | `fix: resolve cursor positioning bug` | 1.2.3 ‚Üí 1.2.4 |
| `feat:`                                           | Minor (0.X.0)     | `feat: add PDF export functionality`  | 1.2.3 ‚Üí 1.3.0 |
| `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:`                    | Major (X.0.0)     | `feat!: redesign document API`        | 1.2.3 ‚Üí 2.0.0 |
| `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:` | No version change | `docs: update README`                 | 1.2.3 ‚Üí 1.2.3 |

### Commit Message Format

```bash
# Feature with scope
feat(editor): add table support

# Bug fix with detailed description
fix: resolve memory leak in collaboration module

- Clear event listeners on disconnect
- Add cleanup in useEffect
- Fix WebSocket connection disposal

Fixes #456

# Breaking change (two ways)
feat!: change document format to support annotations

# Or with footer
feat: redesign plugin API

BREAKING CHANGE: Plugins must now export a default function
```

### Release Workflow

#### Automatic Releases

1. **Pre-release from main**:

   - Every merge to `main` triggers tests
   - If tests pass, publishes `X.Y.Z-next.N` to npm
   - Example: `1.0.0-next.1`, `1.0.0-next.2`

2. **Stable release (promoting from main)**:

   - Use GitHub Actions "Promote to Stable" workflow
   - Merges main to stable branch
   - Publishes stable version (e.g., `1.0.0`)
   - Automatically syncs back to main

3. **Hotfix to current stable**:

   - Create fix branch from `stable`
   - Push fix commits
   - Merge PR ‚Üí publishes patch version
   - Auto-syncs to main

4. **Patch old versions**:
   - Use "Create Patch Branch" workflow
   - Input version (e.g., `1.0`)
   - Creates `1.0.x` branch
   - Apply fixes ‚Üí publishes `1.0.1`, `1.0.2`, etc.

#### Manual Testing

Preview what will be released:

```bash
npx semantic-release --dry-run --no-ci
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Details

For comprehensive information about our CI/CD workflows, automated testing, and release pipelines, see [cicd.md](cicd.md).

npm run format:check

# Auto-fix formatting
npm run format

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix
```

### Documentation
